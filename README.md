# Virtual_Network_Switch
  A network switch operates on the network layer 2 of the OSI model. In a local area network (LAN) using Ethernet, a network switch determines where to send each incoming message frame by looking at the physical device address (or MAC address). Switches maintain tables that match each MAC address, to the port where that MAC address station is connected. If a frame arrives at a port and the destination MAC address is unknown to the switch infrastructure, then it is flooded to all ports in the switching domain.
  Our simulator will implement the network switch functionality. The switch will have 4 ports, where each port can be enabled or disabled based on the requirement through the command line interface. Once the port is allocated to a process, the respective port can send or receive the frames. Switch, upon receiving a frame from a port, based on the destination MAC address in the frame header, it will look up the MAC address table, and send the frame to the destined port. If the destination MAC address is not available in the MAC address table, then that frame is flooded to all ports except the port on which it is arrived.  
  Virtual Network Switch will comprise several different components like switch, ports, stations. Each component has to be programmed. The language used to implement these components is ‘C language’. Ports can be implemented using Message Queues, which is one type of Inter Process Communication (IPC). The state of the port (i.e enabled or disabled) and status of a station (i.e connected or disconnected) can be implemented using Shared Memory, another type of IPC. This setup will allow for multiple stations to connect to switch via ports and be able to send or receive frames with full-duplex functionality.
  
Switch Architecture: Switch can be implemented using a C program. Switch has 4 ports which all are enabled by default. Administrator can be able to disable a port or enable it back. Switch handles all types of frames like unicast, unknown unicast and broadcast frames. Upon receiving a frame from a port, based on the destination MAC address, it looks up the MAC Table, and forwards that frame to the destined station.

Port Architecture: Ports in the switch enable connection between switch and station so that switch can receive frames from a station and send frames to a destined station. Basically, ports act as a communication layer between switch and station. So we can implement this functionality using message queue, one type of Inter Process Communication (IPC). In this project, switch and stations are nothing but just processes, so the message queue is best fit here. The state of port is available across all stations via shared memory.

Station Architecture: Station can be implemented using a C program. Users will be able to connect the station to switch via port of her/his wish. Users are able to send frames from a station using a port (implemented using message queue) which is eventually received by the switch. Also all stations can receive frames and either accept it or discard it, based on the destination mac address of the frame. The status of the station is available to switch via shared memory. This shared memory stores both the station's process id and its mac address.
